# Quiz-game
 
Project 2
Code Isntitute

This is a simple quiz game that tests your knowledge with true/false questions. This game includes: a log-in form, a set of questions, a track of your score and a form for feedback.

Design

Colour Scheme

I choosed a pallet from coolors that is not so bright and makes that the quiz container color pops up more than the background color. The dark color was used in the back, the bright yellow in the quiz container and other colors were used in the buttons.

Typography

The chosen typography was adquired from google fonts. 
I chosed "Exo 2" for all the text because is a redable font and it suits a game.

Imagery

I haven't used any pictures for this project because it was mostly focused on the development of Javascript. But, I used just one image from favicons for the website representation. 
The image is displayed in the browser tab.

The screenshots used for this readme file were transformed from png to webp using the webp converter. 


Wireframes

Most wireframes were made old school with pen and paper. I have used FIGMA just for a quick representation in README.

FEATURES

The log in box:

Here is a simple log-in box that requires an e-mai adress. It prevents the default form submission behavior, shows an alert indicating that the user has logged in, hides the login form, and then displays the main content container. This provides a basic user interface response to a successful login. After the user has logged in the box dissapears giving more focus to the quiz container. 
The log in feature is optional.

The landing page image

The landing page includes the log-in box and the Quiz container.
Inside the quiz container we have different buttons:

- Start Button: 
- True and False buttons
- Reset Button 
- Leave feedback button

Feedback Form

*In this page, the users provide basic information about themselves. Name, last name, email adress and some questions. The questions are important for the team to know a little bit more about the users and their experience in the water. 
*S&W team can locate people in the most adaptable group. Then, they can contact the users about what is avaiable.

Future Implementations

- I need to be more clear with class and division names. Less elements can lead me to less code and less confusion.
- I found Figma and I want to use it more. Is very useful for websites, designs, inspiration and even the wireframe. 

Accessibility
The page is easy to read and understand. The user will be able to return to all three pages from all three pages. The colors are relaxing to the eye wich makes the user stay longer in the site. The font-families are friendly to dislexic users. In the project, I have include the sans-serif font family and "alt" to all images, which make easier for users with dissabilities to read. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Languages Used

As I'm starting with coding, the langUages of this project are exclusively HTML & CSS.
I've been using Gitpod for editing the project and Github for deployment. 
I used Reddit to make changes that I didn't want to affect the project untill I was satisfied with those. Then, I copied my changes from Reddit and pasted in Gitpod. 
I have used some of Deftools specially the screen sizing.

Testing

*Home, Gallery and Application are responsive. 
*The footer redirect the users to google maps, all social media avaiable and even email draft. 
*The site is avaiable and readable in on all devices. 
*HTML. No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
*CSS. No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Bugs

I've been correcting and adjusting small mistakes in all the process of this project. 
I had a big problem that I was refering to the wrong element and the variables that I had from the beginning were not clear, therfore I had to erase some variables and make a new one just with current question. 
My experience was that I should't create too many variables and better to create them when I need them. 
I made some improvements and the quiz ended up functioning better.

Some problems that I found are:
- Media query was difficult to adapt after I was done with most of the project. 
- I had to go back to CSS theory because of details that I couldn't remember. 
- JavaScript is a fun language but I need more projects to practice so I can apply more or the theory. 

Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
From the "Code and automation" source select "pages"
On Github Pages find "Source", choose "deploy from a branch".
On branch you will find two dop-down menus. Choose "main", "root" and push the "save button".
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Code Used
Most of the code I used was from my notes, the W3schools and the help I got from Slack. 
Some parts I used from "love running" walkthrough project as the meta tags, part of the footer and the overlay text on the main page. I realized that is hard to use the exact code from others because all works different in my site, so I didn't trust just to copy someone's code, I've been trying to get inspiration from others and then adapt it to my project. 
I had assesory from a private teacher in Sweden (Superproff).  He made me think about several things that I could change so my media query won't be wrong. 

Credits
The code was mostly based from the "Love running" walk-through project and 
many other credits are to YouTube Tutorials from:
- Dave Gray teaches code. I got information about Media Query. https://youtu.be/mpYtrgB3b6o?si=tcBwVgdc5glg_Nvu
- Kevin Powell teaches the CSS common misstakes.  https://youtu.be/rxnX1jdoI6c?si=MVfpxYCRFvbaRnaU
- Skillthrive. Here I got inspiration for the navigation bar. https://youtu.be/PwWHL3RyQgk?si=pcpu4M5ay6js0GTn

Acknowledgments

I want to thank specially to Tarek Bermalm. He is my private teacher in Sweden. He was a big support and a very patience teacher 

I made a most of my code in Replit and after I tested and saw that everything was working fine I wrote the code in gitpod. One big issue about Replit is that the changes are not all the time uppdated, which made me re do alot of the code in gitpod. 

I got inspiration for this README from Kera_Hackteam. This README had my own template from Project N.1.  Some of the used websites are the same.  

The tutor team was avaiable most of the times I asked questions but because of the time it takes to get help I tried to do mostly everything by myself.
